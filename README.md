"# E-CommerceSystem-" 

Backend for a simple e-commerce platform that manages **Products, Users, Orders, Order Lines, and Reviews**.


##  Goal

Provide a clean, extensible API that:
- Exposes CRUD for core entities (Products, Users, Orders, Reviews).
- Handles order placement (with line items) and total calculation.
- Tracks product stock and supports user reviews.
- Is easy to evolve (layers, DTOs, mapping, testing).
